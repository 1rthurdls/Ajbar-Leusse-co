Dear user,

Today you decided to inform you about the climate change impacts. 
Because to often when people talk about this they do not link data, graphs, numbers,... with their saying, therefore
you decided to use the software that the Habibis's team develloped to have precise data easily.

How to use our software ? 

We all have called a call center and eventough it might be annoying to call them the way they work is very efficient.

Therefore we insipred ourself of this way of working for our software. 

You have 3 steps to do to access a certain data :

1) open your terminal
2) type : 'python' 'name of the file (if you didn't change its name it schould be interactiveint.py)
3)follow the instructions given by the software

Best regards 

Habibis's team
